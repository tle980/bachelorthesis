# Bachelor Thesis

This repo has all the code for my final Bachelor Project. 

Slamdata folder contains all the grandslam data used in the project. Most files I used are points.csv, and I intially used matches.csv to cross-reference but its totally run-able without the matches.csv files.

"draft.ipynb" contains my original and full work on US Open.
"draft_Wimbledon.ipynb" is a earlier version of "draft.ipynb" so some new functions and plots might be missing. 

To run these (running the ipynb), just make sure your enviroment has all the library I put at the beginning of these "draft" files and make sure that read_csv is reading the correct path on your device.
